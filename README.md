### Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ryan Lee. My passion is front-end web development, specifically using React.js. I am currently in my last unit at Lambda School and plan to be endorsed and looking for a job by December 2020.

My skills thus far are in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, SQLite, and introductory knowledge of Python.
